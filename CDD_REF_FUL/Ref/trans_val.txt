RGS proteins regulate many aspects of embryonic development such as glial differentiation, embryonic axis formation, skeletal and muscle development, cell migration during early embryogenesis, as well as apoptosis, cell proliferation, and modulation of cardiac development.	Thus, these RGS proteins are likely to regulate a subset of the G-protein signalling pathways in mammalian cells.	2
They are a diverse group of multifunctional proteins that regulate cellular signaling events downstream of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).	In other cases, RGS proteins integrate G proteins with signaling pathways linked to such diverse cellular responses as cell growth and differentiation, cell motility, and intracellular trafficking.	4

RGS22 contains at least 3 copies of the RGS domain in vertebrata and exists in multiple splicing variants.	The singular nature of the RGS21 domain structure is typical of the A/RZ and B/R4 subfamilies (Figs. 2&3) but is unlike other superfamily members that either contain two or more RGS-boxes in tandem (i.e., the PKA regulatory subunit binding partner D-AKAP2 and the testes-specific protein PRTD-NY2 [a.k.a. RGS22; Willard & Siderovski, unpublished observations]) or possess one or more functional modules beyond the defining RGS-box (Fig. 2).	3

The RGS (Regulator of G-protein Signaling) domain found in the RGS22 protein, a member of the RA/RGS subfamily of the RGS protein family.	In 1996, we and others identified a superfamily of RGS ("regulator of G-protein signaling") proteins that bind Galpha subunits via a hallmark ~120 amino-acid "RGS-box" domain, dramatically accelerating their intrinsic GTPase activity, and thus attenuating heterotrimer-linked signaling (reviewed in).	1

Kozasa et al. first demonstrated in 1998 that the RGS-box of p115-RhoGEF is a potent GAP for both Galpha12 and Galpha13 subunits; more importantly, the same group found that interaction between the RGS-box and Galpha13 GTP, but not Galpha12 GTP, serves to trigger exchange activity by the C-terminal DH/PH cassette.	1
The C-terminus of GRK2 and 3 contains a plekstrin homology domain (PH) with binding sites for the membrane phospholipid PIP2 and free G#?	For example, we identified an N-terminal PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology) domain within the longest isoform of the R12 subfamily member RGS12 (Fig. 2); this PDZ domain is capable of binding peptides derived from the C-termini of 7TM receptors, including from one of the interleukin-8 receptors (CXCR2).	1

ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	RESULTS: The Syk-C:peptide structure is compared with liganded structures of both the SH2 domain of Src and the C-terminal SH2 domain of ZAP-70 (the 70 kDa zeta-associated protein).	1.5
ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain is a sequence-specific phosphotyrosine-binding module present in many signaling molecules.	2.5
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	Both Syk SH2 (Src homology 2) domains are required for high-affinity binding to these motifs, but the C-terminal SH2 domain (Syk-C) can function independently and can bind, in isolation, to the tyrosine-phosphorylated IgE receptor in vitro.	2.5
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	Zap70 and the closely related kinase Syk contain two N-terminal SH2 domains instead of the Src SH3-SH2 domain arrangement (Figure 1).	2.5
ZAP-70 and Syk comprise a family of hematopoietic cell specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are required for antigen and antibody receptor function.

In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	It has been shown that Jak function is independent of phosphotyrosine binding and it is assumed that the Jak SH2 domain plays a structural role rather than serving as a substrate recruitment module and its influence on Jak kinase activity is unknown.	1
In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	While the mechanism of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) recognition is remarkably conserved among the SH2 domains, differences in recognition of phosphopeptide residues N and especially C-terminal to the pTyr have been identified that contribute to selectivity.	3
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	The separation of the SH2 and kinase domains and absence of a ligand occupying the SH2 binding site result in partial unfolding of the SH2 domain and higher mobility of alphaC in the kinase domain.	2
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	Many aspects of Src inactivation are conserved in Abl kinases, which are also autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions of the SH2/SH3 domains.	1

They consist of two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain separated from the SH2 domains by a linker or hinge region.	In nonreceptor tyrosine kinases the conserved SH2-kinase unit is flanked by a number of additional domains which may comprise the N-terminal flanking region, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a second SH2 domain, a sequence of PH-BTK-SH3 domains, a 'Four-point-one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin' (FERM) domain, or an F-BAR domain.	2
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) comprise a family of enzymes that catalyze the coupling of amino acids with their matching tRNAs.	For several Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), the rate determining step in aminoacylation is the dissociation of the charged tRNA from the enzyme.	3

This involves the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate using ATP, followed by the transfer of the activated amino acid to the 3'-adenosine moiety of the tRNA.	In the first step, the amino acid or its precursor reacts with ATP to form the activated aminoacyl-adenylate (aa-AMP) within the catalytic site, and in the second, or charging step, the amino acid is transferred to the 3' end of the cognate tRNA.	5
This involves the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate using ATP, followed by the transfer of the activated amino acid to the 3'-adenosine moiety of the tRNA.	In the second step, the amino acid moiety on the adenylate is transferred to the 2' hydroxyl group at the 3' end of the tRNA with the simultaneous formation of an AMP product.	4
The GST-C-like domain of GluRS is involved in protein-protein interactions.	GluRS is part of the Class Ib subgroup with a set of alpha-helices (four-helix junction or 4HJ) connecting the CD to the C-terminal, alpha-helical ACB domain.	2
The GST-C-like domain of GluRS is involved in protein-protein interactions.	In fact, the crystal structures reveal that all three domains adopt a GST-like fold (Figure 3) and searching the Protein Data Bank for proteins structurally related to Arc1p-N, GluRS-N and MetRS-N with DALI reveals matches to GSTs from diverse species as bacteria, yeast, plants and humans.	2.5

Semaphorins are regulatory molecules in the development of the nervous system and in axonal guidance.	In the nervous system, for example, semaphorin expression is often associated with growing axons as they form axonal tracts, but this expression often decreases following the formation of the tracts.	4
Semaphorins are regulatory molecules in the development of the nervous system and in axonal guidance.	Although semaphorins are involved in axonal guidance and neural development, we detected comparatively low levels of expression of SEMA3B in whole brain extracts.	5
They also play important roles in other biological processes, such as angiogenesis, immune regulation, respiration systems and cancer.	However, studies have shown that SEMA3s are also secreted by other cell types, including tumor cells, where they play an inhibitory role in tumor growth and angiogenesis (specifically SEMA3B and SEMA3F).	4

One highly induced transcript identified in this screen was SEMA3B, a protein involved in diverse biological processes including axon guidance, tumor suppression, and immune modulation.	4
Both Sema3B and Sema3F show high levels of expression in normal tissues and low-grade tumors but are down-regulated in highly metastatic tumors in the lung, melanoma cells, bladder carcinoma cells and prostate carcinoma.	Thus, up-regulated expression of SEMA3B and SEMA3F is likely to inhibit the growth of the cancer cells in the metastatic sites due to a decrease in cell adhesive ability.	3
Both Sema3B and Sema3F show high levels of expression in normal tissues and low-grade tumors but are down-regulated in highly metastatic tumors in the lung, melanoma cells, bladder carcinoma cells and prostate carcinoma.

The Sema domain is located at the N-terminus and contains four disulfide bonds formed by eight conserved cysteine residues.	The sema domain is also a critical component through which semaphorins mediate their effects.	1
Two receptor families, the neuropilins (NP) and plexins, have been implicated in mediating the actions of semaphorins 3B and 3F.	Interestingly, neuropilins also bind plexins, such that class 3 semaphorins, which bind to neuropilins, signal their effects through the cytoplasmic domain of plexins.	4
Two receptor families, the neuropilins (NP) and plexins, have been implicated in mediating the actions of semaphorins 3B and 3F.	SEMA3B belongs to the secreted class 3 semaphorins (SEMA3), which form a complex with neuropilins (Np-1 and Np-2) and plexins on the cell surface.	5
Sema3B is a member of the class 3 semaphorin family of proteins.	This is one of the first studies to show that a member of the secreted semaphorin family exerts a biological effect on bone mineral density in vivo and uncovers a potential role for SEMA3B in modulating osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.	2.5
Sema3B is a member of the class 3 semaphorin family of proteins.	SEMA3B is a secreted protein that belongs to the large semaphorin family of neurotrophic factors.	3
It serves as a receptor-recognition and -binding module.	The existence of common receptor(s) for both VEGF and semaphorin(s) implies that these factors might compete for the same binding sites on the cell surface.	3

They play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of gastric carcinoma.	In conclusion, semaphorin 5A and plexin B3 expression increases significantly with gastric carcinoma progression, and semaphorin 5A and plexin B3 may be involved in the processes of gastric cancer invasion and metastasis.	5

The stimulation of plexin B3 by Sema5A binding in human glioma cells results in the inhibition of cell migration and invasion.	In conclusion, we show that Sema5A inhibits cell migration and invasive growth of glioma cells via its receptor plexin-B3.	5
The stimulation of plexin B3 by Sema5A binding in human glioma cells results in the inhibition of cell migration and invasion.	To ascertain the role of plexin-B3 in relaying the signal of Sema5A in inhibiting glioma cell invasion, the endogenous expression of plexin-B3 in glioma cells was subjected to down-regulation by RNAi prior to Sema5A stimulation.	4
The Sema domain is located at the N-terminus and contains four disulfide bonds formed by eight conserved cysteine residues.	These data indicate that the sema domain is both essential and sufficient for homophilic binding.	1.5
The Sema domain is located at the N-terminus and contains four disulfide bonds formed by eight conserved cysteine residues.	Using different deletion constructs we show that the sema domain of B3 is essential for homophilic interaction.	1.5
Plexin B3 has been linked to verbal performance and white matter volume in human brain.	However, very little is known about the expression and role of semaphorin 5A and plexin B3 in human cancers including gastric carcinoma.	1
It serves as a ligand-recognition and -binding module.	Ligand binding and genetic analyses demonstrate that PlexB is a receptor for the secreted semaphorin Sema-2a, suggesting that secreted and transmembrane semaphorins in Drosophila use PlexB and PlexA, respectively, for axon pathfinding during neural development.	2.5
It serves as a ligand-recognition and -binding module.	In fact, it has been shown that activation of plexin-B1 signaling by the ligand Sema4D triggers its endogenous GTPase-activating protein activity toward R-Ras, thereby negatively regulating integrin functions, and may potentially suppress metastasis.	2
Furthermore, Sema5A and plexin B3 have been implicated in the progression of various types of cancer.	The inactivation of Rac1 by Sema5A and plexin-B3 may therefore engage these functions of RhoGDIalpha.	1

It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	The GTP-binding (G) domain resides in the gamma subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF2; however, only eIF2beta, and not eIF2gamma, has been reported to directly bind to eIF5 or eIF2B.	4

It is closely related to SelB, the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor from eubacteria.	Site-directed mutagenesis confirms a binding mode of the tRNA molecule similar to that observed with the elongation factor.	1
The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	Although the exact mechanism is not known, it is suggested that subunit antiassociation may occur by an allosteric transition, by steric hindrance, or perhaps by preventing the displacement of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA from the 40S by the 60S subunit.	2
The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	In eukarya, translation begins at the 5' capped end of mRNA with the formation of a 43S ribosomal complex containing the small 40S ribosomal subunit, an eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA complex and several initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF3).	2.5
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	Although eIF5 binds directly to eIF2 ternary complex off the 40S subunit, this interaction is not sufficient to induce eIF2's GTPase activity.	1.5
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	eIF2, GTP, and Met- form a ternary complex, which together with eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A binds to the 40S subunit to form a 43S complex.	2
Both eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon are known to bind strongly to eIF2-beta, but have also been shown to bind directly to eIF2-gamma.	(A,B) Association of 32P-eIF3j-(A) and 32P-eIF3j+ (B) with 48S complexes assembled on beta-globin mRNA in the presence of eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F before and after incubation with eIF5, DeltaeIF5B, and 60S subunits, as indicated, and assayed after sucrose density gradient centrifugation by Cerenkov counting and gel electrophoresis/autoradiography of peak fractions (inset panels).	2

The gamma subunit has no intrinsic GTPase activity, but is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and GDP/GTP exchange is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. eIF2B is a heteropentamer, and the epsilon chain binds eIF2.	The GTP-binding (G) domain resides in the gamma subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF2; however, only eIF2beta, and not eIF2gamma, has been reported to directly bind to eIF5 or eIF2B.	3.5
The gamma subunit has no intrinsic GTPase activity, but is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and GDP/GTP exchange is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. eIF2B is a heteropentamer, and the epsilon chain binds eIF2.	Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP is induced by eIF5, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for eIF2, which provides an "arginine finger" for the catalytic center of eIF2gamma.	4
eIF2 is a heterotrimeric translation initiation factor that consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.	eIF2 is composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma.	5
eIF2 is a heterotrimeric translation initiation factor that consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.	The factor eIF5 stimulates hydrolysis of GTP by eIF2 upon AUG codon recognition, whereas the factor eIF2B promotes guanine nucleotide exchange on eIF2 to recycle the factor for additional rounds of translation initiation.	1.5
Following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, eIF2:GDP is released from the ribosome.	There are therefore striking parallels between subunit joining in eukaryotes (in which hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and release of eIF2-GDP are followed by eIF5B-mediated joining of a 60S subunit to a 40S subunit bound by Met- eIF1, eIF3, and probably eIF1A) and in prokaryotes (in which IF2 is thought to enhance joining of a 50S subunit to a 30S subunit bound by fMet-tRNA and IF1, IF2, and IF3).	3
Following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, eIF2:GDP is released from the ribosome.	It has been widely assumed that eIF5-induced hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and release of eIF2-GDP from 48S complexes lead to release of all other factors (e.g.,).	4
Both factors are GTPases; however, eubacterial IF-2 is a single polypeptide, while eIF2 is heterotrimeric.	Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP did not alter the cross-linking patterns of mRNA with ribosomal proteins or eIF3 in 48S complexes (Fig. 6G, lane 2) and therefore did not dramatically alter the position of mRNA on 40S subunits or its interaction with eIF3.	1.5
Both factors are GTPases; however, eubacterial IF-2 is a single polypeptide, while eIF2 is heterotrimeric.	Release of initiation factors from 48S complexes assembled on beta-globin mRNA after hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP.	1

This family includes translation initiation, elongation, and release factors.	Here, we review observations that several initiation factors and one elongation factor of Escherichia coli, first isolated as required to reconstitute translation, bear a surprising degree of similarity in structure and function to the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4A and eIF5A and to the elongation factor eEF3, previously described as a fungus-specific protein.	1.5
eIF2-gamma is found only in eukaryotes and archaea.	48S complexes were assembled by incubating 30 pmol 40S subunits, 50 pmol [35S]-Met-, 100 pmol eIF2, 50 pmol unlabeled or 32P-phosphorylated eIF3j+ or eIF3j-, 150 pmol eIF1, and eIF1A with different combinations of 50 pmol eIF4F, 100 pmol eIF4A, 50 pmol eIF4B, 1 nm AUG triplet, and 50 pmol unlabeled or 32P-labeled mRNA (as indicated in the text) in 200 muL buffer B plus 1 mM ATP + 0.4 mM unlabeled or gamma[32P]GTP for 10 min at 37 C.	1

Isoaspartyl dipeptidase hydrolyzes the beta-L-isoaspartyl linkages in dipeptides, as part of the degradative pathway to eliminate proteins with beta-L-isoaspartyl peptide bonds, bonds whereby the beta-group of an aspartate forms the peptide link with the amino group of the following amino acid.	We have expressed and crystallized the 390 amino acid residue isoaspartyl dipeptidase (IadA) from E.coli, and have determined its crystal structure in the absence and presence of the phosphinic inhibitor Asp-Psi[PO(2)CH(2)]-LeuOH.	2

SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) box of SOCS6-like proteins.	The CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 protein) and SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) are a family of intracellular proteins, several of which have emerged as key physiological regulators of cytokine responses, including those that regulate the inflammatory systems.	3.5
SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) box of SOCS6-like proteins.	In this report, we demonstrate that the Elongin BC complex also binds to a functional BC box present in the SOCS box, a sequence motif identified recently in the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) protein, as well as in a collection of additional proteins belonging to the SOCS, ras, WD-40 repeat, SPRY domain, and ankyrin repeat families.	2
The general function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	Krebs and Hilton discuss research implicating SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 as inhibitors of insulin receptor-mediated and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-mediated signaling pathways, as well as the increasing evidence that SOCS proteins may act in part by participating in a ubiquitin ligase complex to promote the degradation of target proteins.	3.5
The general function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	However, the SOCS box is also known to be important for stabilization and/or degradation of the SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins themselves.	2.5
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.	In these experiments, T7-tagged SOCS-1 proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells with or without Elongins B and C.	1.5
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.	To measure binding of Elongins B and C to SOCS-box proteins from insect cells or E. coli, baculovirus-infected cell lysates or purified, renatured bacterially expressed proteins were incubated with antibody for 1 hr at 4 C and then with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz) for 1 hr.	2.5
Therefore, SOCS-box-containing proteins probably function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate the degradation of proteins associated through their N-terminal regions.	The SOCS box has also been found in ASBs (ankyrin repeat-containing proteins with a SOCS box), SSBs (SPRY domain-containing proteins with a SOCS box) and WSBs (WD40 repeat-containing proteins with a SOCS box), as well as other miscellaneous proteins.	2
Therefore, SOCS-box-containing proteins probably function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate the degradation of proteins associated through their N-terminal regions.	The function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	4
Together with CIS1, the CIS/SOCS family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal SOCS box and a central SH2 domain.

The vitamin B6 complex comprises pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, as well as the 5'-phosphate esters of pyridoxal (PALP) and pyridoxamine, the last two being the biologically active coenzyme derivatives.	Intriguingly, the ligand for cystathionine beta-synthase, i.e., SAM, has a positively charged sulfur atom in approximately the same position as the negatively charged phosphate of AMP, and it is likely that Asp444 forms an electrostatic interaction with this sulfur atom.	1

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the pyridoxal-phosphate (PALP) dependent enzyme domain upstream.	Human cystathionine beta--synthase (CBS) is an S-adenosylmethionine-regulated enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of homocysteine.	1
The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site.	Kraus and coworkers provided evidence that the CBS domains form an autoinhibitory domain whose effect is relieved by SAM binding, which is consistent with the idea that the CBS domains might represent the binding site for SAM, although this had not been directly demonstrated.	2.5
The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site.	There is an interesting parallel here with the regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which contain two tandem binding sites for cAMP, although these are not related to CBS domains.	1
The members of the PALP family are principally involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and amino acid-derived metabolites, but they are also found in the biosynthetic pathways of amino sugars and other amine-containing compounds.

The members of the PALP family are principally involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids and amino acid-derived metabolites, but they are also found in the biosynthetic pathways of amino sugars and other amine-containing compounds.	These "hot spots" for pathogenic mutations are likely to be directly involved in binding of the adenosine-containing ligand.	1
CBS is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins.	In fact the second CBS domain in cystathionine beta-synthase is rather poorly conserved (ref.; see also the PFAM database, entry no. PF00571, ref.).	2.5
CBS is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins.	In the case of cystathionine beta-synthase, the CBS domains appear to have been adapted to bind not an adenine nucleotide, but a related adenosine-containing compound, SAM.	3
CBS domains usually come in tandem repeats, which associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair which is reflected in this model.	This shows that tandem pairs of CBS domains act, in most cases, as sensors of cellular energy status and, as such, represent a newly identified class of binding domain for adenosine derivatives.	2

Acinus contains a P-loop motif and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), also termed RBD (RNA binding domain) or RNP (ribonucleoprotein domain), which indicates Acinus might have ATPase and DNA/RNA-binding activity.	As AAC-11, through binding to Acinus, prevents the apoptotic cleavage of Acinus (Figure 3A), it is possible that AAC-11 regulates Acinus role in apoptotic DNA laddering and that caspase cleavage of Acinus is required for DNA fragmentation.	1.5

The UPR is initiated by the ER-resident protein kinase and endonuclease IRE1, which promotes non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, facilitating its translation.	The unfolded protein response (UPR) in eukaryotes upregulates factors that restore ER homeostasis upon protein folding stress and in yeast is activated by a non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA.	4
The bZIP structural motif contains a basic region and a leucine zipper, composed of alpha helices with leucine residues 7 amino acids apart, which stabilize dimerization with a parallel leucine zipper domain.	Over the last 15 years, numerous studies have addressed the structural rules that regulate dimerization stability and dimerization specificity of the leucine zipper, a dimeric parallel coiled-coil domain that can either homodimerize or heterodimerize.	3.5

HAC1 (also called Hac1p or HacA) is a bZIP transcription factor that plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR).	Hac1u is not a favorable mRNA for protein translation, but after splicing Hac1i is translated very efficiently, and its product, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor Hac1p activates transcription of the UPR target genes by binding to the unfolded protein response element (UPRE).	3.5

Dimerization occurs in a specific and predictable manner resulting in hundreds of dimers having unique effects on transcription.	The eukaryotic initiation factor of translation eIF2alpha is phosphorylated (eIF2alpha-P) resulting in two effects: (i) the overall translation rate is reduced to save precursors of translation during amino acid limitation and (ii) GCN4 mRNA translation is increased to produce larger amounts of this transcription factor, which then activates numerous genes for amino acid biosynthesis.	1

The inherent flexibility between DH and PH domains would be restricted under controlled cellular conditions, i.e., at membranes and upon the binding of specific phosphoinositides to the PH domain, which would favor productive engagement of both portions of the cassette with cognate GTPases.	1
RhoGEFs, Kalirin and Trio, the mammalian homologs of Drosophila Trio and Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-73 regulate a novel step in secretory granule maturation.	Recent observations demonstrating that Rho proteins play a role in regulated exocytosis by neuroendocrine cells, coupled with the fact that both Kalirin and Trio interact with a secretory granule resident protein, make these two GEFs obvious candidates to control Rho-mediated processes related to the secretory granule physiology.	3

The first RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette catalyzes exchange on Rac1 and RhoG while the second RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette is specific for RhoA.	Similarly, the N-terminal DH/PH fragment of Trio, which catalyzes exchange on both Rac1 and RhoG, is four-fold more active in vitro than the isolated DH domain.	4
The first RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette catalyzes exchange on Rac1 and RhoG while the second RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette is specific for RhoA.	Together, these data strongly suggest that the N-terminal DH/PH cassette of Trio might use its PH domain similarly to Dbs when catalyzing exchange on its cognate GTPases Rac1 and RhoG.	3.5
Kalirin and Trio are closely related to p63RhoGEF and have PH domains of similar function.

Kalirin and Trio are closely related to p63RhoGEF and have PH domains of similar function.	The ability of Kalirin and Trio GEF1 to interact with other proteins (e.g., filamin, TrkA) through its PH domain may contribute to its cellular localization, thus explaining why its Rho substrates have similar but not identical phenotypes.	1.5
Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	Cases in which PH domains bind specific phosphoinositides with high affinity are restricted to those phosphoinositides that have a pair of adjacent phosphates in their inositol headgroup.	2.5
Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	A very small proportion of PH domains bind phosphoinositides with high affinity and specificity, and drive their host proteins to particular cellular membranes in a way that can be precisely regulated.	4.5
PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane.	Additional binding energy (and specificity) is derived from hydrogen bonds made with phosphate groups outside this vicinal pair (the 1-phosphate in PtdIns(4,5)P2/Ins(1,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2/Ins(1,3,4)P3; the 1- and 5-phosphates in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 complexes), but the vicinal pair seems to be critical.	3

Neuroendocrine cells store classical transmitters, bioactive peptides and hormones in secretory granules or large dense core vesicles, specialized organelles that differ from synaptic vesicles in dimensions and biogenesis.	1
Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains.	Thus, the property for which PH domains first became known is actually a rare property for the domain class, only relevant for 3% of yeast PH domains.	1
Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains.	Detailed analysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding by the PH domain from the amino terminus of phospholipase C-delta1 (PLC-delta1) then provided the first demonstration of specific phosphoinositide recognition by a PH domain.	1
A few display strong specificity in lipid binding.	PH domains with apparent specificity for PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2 have been reported based on lipid overlay experiments in which binding of GST/PH domain fusion proteins to nitrocellulose filters spotted with phosphoinositides is studied.	2.5
A few display strong specificity in lipid binding.	Our yeast studies showed that only six additional PH domains (from Boi1p, Boi2p, Cla4p, Osh1p, Osh2p, and Skm1p) possess reasonably strong phosphoinositide binding in vitro.	3.5
They share little sequence conservation, but all have a common fold, which is electrostatically polarized.	Therefore, while it is not conclusive that these GEFs also require direct engagement of their cognate GTPases by their DH-associated PH domains for full exchange potential, sequence conservation shared among this set of GEFs strongly suggests this possibility.	1
They share little sequence conservation, but all have a common fold, which is electrostatically polarized.	In many other cases, it is quite likely that alternative binding partners are more relevant, and that the observed PH domain homology represents conservation of structural fold rather than function.	3.5
PH domains have diverse functions, but in general are involved in targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular location or in the interaction with a binding partner.	Second, I will consider the implications for PH domains in general from our recent genome-wide survey of the their phosphoinositide-binding properties in yeast.	1.5

While the residues of Dbs and Trio that mediate the interface between their PH domains and cognate GTPase are conserved only in a subset of Dbl-family GEFs, recent data shows that more distantly related Dbl-family GEFs also use their DH-associated PH domain to engage their cognate GTPases, albeit through different interactions.	1

The abundant homohexameric AAA ATPase, p97/VCP (Cdc48 in yeast), participates in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated degradation (ERAD), membrane fusion, and autophagy . In many of these processes, p97 is thought to recognize ubiquitinated substrates and separate them from tightly bound partner proteins.	2
UBXD7, also known as UBXN7, functions as a ubiquitin-binding adaptor that mediates the interaction between the AAA+ ATPase p97 (also known as VCP or Cdc48) and the transcription factor HIF1alpha.	Importantly, while various p97-adapter complexes associate with different ubiquitin ligases, the UBXD7 adapter (also known as UBXN7, or in yeast, Ubx5) stands out because it is the only adapter to have been implicated in direct binding to CRLs.	3
UBXD7 contains the ubiquitin-associated (UBA), ubiquitin-associating (UAS), ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX), and ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) domains.

It binds only to the active, NEDD8- or Rub1-modified form of cullins.	Because of the apparent selectivity for neddylated cullins, we also probed Flag-UBXD7 pull-downs with NEDD8 specific antibodies, and detected multiple endogenously neddylated species in the cullin size range, but no unconjugated NEDD8 (Fig. 2b).	3
It binds only to the active, NEDD8- or Rub1-modified form of cullins.	UBXN7 directly interacts with NEDD8 and cullins in vitro.	4

Moreover, UBA-like domain is required for binding ubiquitylated-protein substrates, UIM motif is responsible for the binding to cullin RING ligases (CRLs), and UBX domain is essential for p97 binding.	A recent proteomic analysis revealed that in addition to binding ubiquitin conjugates, UBA-UBX proteins interact with over two dozen ubiquitin ligases, including several members of the Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligase (CRL) family.	2.5
Moreover, UBA-like domain is required for binding ubiquitylated-protein substrates, UIM motif is responsible for the binding to cullin RING ligases (CRLs), and UBX domain is essential for p97 binding.
