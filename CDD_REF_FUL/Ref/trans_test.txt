RGS22 contains at least 3 copies of the RGS domain in vertebrata and exists in multiple splicing variants.	Differences in Galpha selectivity lie, at least in part, in heterogeneity within the structural determinants of Galpha engagement by the RGS domain; initial evidence of heterogeneity was seen in the structures of p115-RhoGEF and GRK2 bound to Galpha13 and Galphaq, respectively, that exhibit unique contacts not observed in the first resolved structures [i.e., RGS4/Galphai1 and RGS9/Galphat; ].	1

These specific interactions could help to maintain a membrane-bound population of GRK2 prior to the agonist-dependent overt GRK2 translocation.	Before our studies, structures of four RGS protein/Galpha complexes had been determined: canonical complexes of RGS4/Galphai1 and RGS9/Galphat/i1, as well as the atypical RGS domain/Galpha pairings of p115-RhoGEF/Galpha13/i1 and GRK2/Galphaq.	1.5
The RGS domain is an essential part of the GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinases 2) and the GRK3 proteins, which are members of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases subfamily.	With the ability to interact with a multitude of proteins by virtue of its PDZ, PTB, and Ras-binding domains, along with Galpha interactions via its RGS-box and GoLoco motif (described below), RGS12 in particular appears to be a signaling nexus or 'hub' capable of coordinating signal transduction from receptor and/or non-receptor tyrosine-kinases and both monomeric (Ras-superfamily) and heterotrimeric G-protein subunits.	2

Preferred substrates of ACY1 are aliphatic amino acids with a short-chain acyl moiety, especially N-acetyl-methionine (Birnbaum et al.).	4
However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids.	Our finding of ACY1 expression in the kidney, which is consistent with previous observations (Cook et al.; Lindner et al.), is also in line with a possible functional role of ACY1 in recycling of N-acetylated amino acids in the kidney, which can explain the highly elevated concentrations of N-acetylated amino acids in the urine of the four children harboring ACY1 mutations.	1

ZAP-70 is expressed in T and natural killer (NK) cells and Syk is expressed in B cells, mast cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, macrophages, and immature T cells.	This result suggests that Syk-C plays a unique role in the intact Syk protein.	1
Phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues within the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAM; consensus sequence Yxx[LI]x(7,8)Yxx[LI]) by the Src-family PTKs is required for efficient interaction of ZAP-70 and Syk with the receptor subunits and for receptor function.	The C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding site is very different from the equivalent region of ZAP-70, suggesting that in contrast to ZAP-70, the two SH2 domains of Syk can function as independent units.	2

Primary cerebellar neurons (Figure 7a-f), but not astrocytes (Figure 7g-i) or oligodendrocytes (Figure 7j-l) of six days old mice grown under selective conditions express PlxnB3, suggesting the possibility that neuronally expressed B3 may be involved in mediation of the B3-dependent stimulation of neurite outgrowth.	5

It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	Thus, rather than allosterically regulating eIF2gamma-G domain function via eIF2beta, our data support a model in which the GTPase-activating factor eIF5 and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B modulate eIF2 function through direct interactions with the eIF2gamma-G domain.	3.5
It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	Hydrolysis of eIF2-GTP was induced by adding 200 pmol eIF5 and incubating for 20 min more.	2

The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	As suggested above, the mutual stabilization by eIF3 and mRNA of their association with the 40S subunit may be particularly important following eIF5-induced hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and release of eIF2-GDP from the 48S complex, to maintain the association of mRNA and initiator tRNA with the initiation complex prior to subunit joining.	2
The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	There are therefore striking parallels between subunit joining in eukaryotes (in which hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and release of eIF2-GDP are followed by eIF5B-mediated joining of a 60S subunit to a 40S subunit bound by Met- eIF1, eIF3, and probably eIF1A) and in prokaryotes (in which IF2 is thought to enhance joining of a 50S subunit to a 30S subunit bound by fMet-tRNA and IF1, IF2, and IF3).	2.5
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	43S complexes were assembled from 40S subunits, eIF1A, eIF3, and eIF2/[32P]GTP/ ternary complex; purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation; and incubated with AUG, UUG, CAA triplets, mRNAs, and eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4F, eIF5, and DeltaeIF5B as indicated.	1
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	The ternary complex that is formed, Met-tRNAi-GTP-eIF2 in eukaryotes, is catalyzed by eIF2, although this protein is composed of three subunits; the gamma subunit binds the Met-tRNAi and GTP.	2.5

The gamma subunit has no intrinsic GTPase activity, but is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and GDP/GTP exchange is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. eIF2B is a heteropentamer, and the epsilon chain binds eIF2.	Among these factors are (i) eIF2A, a protein that acts only with AUG in formation of the tRNAi-40S-AUG complex; (ii) eIF2B, a protein that stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP in eIF2:the phosphorylation of eIF2B by a variety of means is involved in a unique series of reactions that are the targets for a negative regulation of translation; (iii) eIF3A and eIF6, which prevent subunit association by binding to the 60S particle; and (iv) the 7mG cap, which occurs as a singular feature o***shortened***	2.5

The KH motif is a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta unit that folds into an alpha-beta structure with a three stranded beta-sheet interupted by two contiguous helices.	Surprisingly, the structure of the ribosomal protein S3 N-terminal domain revealed that the beta-sheet topology of the mini-KH domain is drastically different from the one established for maxi-KH (Fig. 1E).	2
The KH motif is a beta-alpha-alpha-beta-beta unit that folds into an alpha-beta structure with a three stranded beta-sheet interupted by two contiguous helices.	Such an arrangement results in architectural similarity between maxi- and mini-KH: both domains are built from a three-stranded beta-sheet with three alpha-helices packed on one side of it (Figs 1 and 2A).	4
In general, KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA.	Thus to discover the KH motif-containing protein with topology alphabetabetaalphaalphabetabetaalpha (a combination of both type I and II domains, four-stranded beta-sheet with four alpha-helices on one side; Fig. 1A, B, D and E), would be an argument favoring the fourth scenario.	1

SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) box of SOCS6-like proteins.	Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins seem to play an important role in this process.	3
The general function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	As mentioned below, receptor-CIS/SOCS complex is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which could be an important inhibitory mechanism.	2.5
The general function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	The SOCS-box motif has been shown to recruit SOCS proteins to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which results in proteasomal degradation of SOCS-binding partners.	4
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.	In contrast to wild-type SOCS-1, the M1 mutant was unstable in both the presence and absence of cotransfected Elongins B and C.	2
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.	To address the role of the SOCS box and the Elongin BC complex in regulation of Jak2 kinase by SOCS-1, epitope-tagged Elongins B and C, Jak2, and T7-tagged wild-type SOCS-1 or the M1 or M2 mutants were coexpressed in 293T cells.	3
Therefore, SOCS-box-containing proteins probably function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate the degradation of proteins associated through their N-terminal regions.	The SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase family was discovered through genetic requirements for cell cycle progression in budding yeast.	2
Therefore, SOCS-box-containing proteins probably function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and mediate the degradation of proteins associated through their N-terminal regions.	Krebs and Hilton discuss research implicating SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 as inhibitors of insulin receptor-mediated and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-mediated signaling pathways, as well as the increasing evidence that SOCS proteins may act in part by participating in a ubiquitin ligase complex to promote the degradation of target proteins.	3
Together with CIS1, the CIS/SOCS family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal SOCS box and a central SH2 domain.	To date, at least three different modulating mechanisms have been demonstrated: through the SH2 domain they bind to phosphotyrosines on the target protein, leading to inhibition of signal transduction by N-terminal inactivation of JAK, by blocking access of STAT to the receptor sites, or by SOCS box-targeting bound proteins to proteasomal degradation.	3
Together with CIS1, the CIS/SOCS family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a C-terminal SOCS box and a central SH2 domain.

The vitamin B6 complex comprises pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, as well as the 5'-phosphate esters of pyridoxal (PALP) and pyridoxamine, the last two being the biologically active coenzyme derivatives.	The best fits were obtained using a Hill plot model with two identical, interacting sites: bound = 2 x [AMP]h/(B0.5h + [AMP]h), where h is the Hill coefficient and B0.5 is the concentration giving half-maximal binding (Figure 3a and Table 1).	1
It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown.	Our results with IMPDH2 and CLC2 suggest that sensing of cellular energy status by binding of adenine nucleotides may be a general function of CBS domain pairs, rather than being a function restricted to AMPK.	1.5

This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with the pyridoxal-phosphate (PALP) dependent enzyme domain upstream.	Overall, our results show that tandem pairs of CBS domains form allosteric binding sites for adenosine derivatives, i.e., AMP and ATP in the case of AMPK, ATP in the cases of IMPDH and CLC2, and SAM in the case of cystathionine beta-synthase.	2
The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site.	Another unexpected finding was that the CBS domains of gamma2 contain two binding sites for both AMP and ATP.	2
The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site.	Our results suggest that the CBS domain pairs in the tetramer are constrained in a conformation that has a lower affinity for ATP than the isolated domains have, but that binding of ATP to the first site causes a conformational change that is transmitted across the subunit interface to increase the affinity of the remaining CBS domain pairs.	2.5

CBS domains usually come in tandem repeats, which associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair which is reflected in this model.	The crystal structure of a bacterial IMPDH shows that the tandem pair of CBS domains are intimately associated via hydrophobic interactions between homologous beta sheets composed of three strands from one domain and one from the other, making it very unlikely that single domains would be stable.	2

bZIP factors act in networks of homo and heterodimers in the regulation of a diverse set of cellular processes.	At least 13 bZIP transcription factors exist in S. cerevisiae, whereas the increasing complexity during evolution is reflected by a minimum of 51 bZIP factors in humans.	2.5
bZIP factors act in networks of homo and heterodimers in the regulation of a diverse set of cellular processes.	Our results resolve the previous conundrum regarding Hac1i binding behavior to provide an integrated model of UPR target gene regulation and shed new light on the basic mechanisms by which bZIP transcription factors recognize their target genes.	2
The UPR is initiated by the ER-resident protein kinase and endonuclease IRE1, which promotes non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, facilitating its translation.	Once activated, the endoribonuclease domain of Ire1 cleaves an unconventional intron from the HAC1 mRNA, producing a frame-shift that directs the translation of the bZIP transcription factor Hac1p that serves as the master transcriptional regulator of the UPR.	5
The UPR is initiated by the ER-resident protein kinase and endonuclease IRE1, which promotes non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, facilitating its translation.

Dimerization of leucine zippers creates a pair of the adjacent basic regions that bind DNA and undergo conformational change.	In bHLH-ZIP proteins, the addition of a leucine-zipper region immediately carboxyl-terminal to the helix-loop-helix region provides for an additional level of both dimerization specificity and control, again through the interaction of amphipathic alpha-helices.	3
Dimerization of leucine zippers creates a pair of the adjacent basic regions that bind DNA and undergo conformational change.

The ability of Kalirin and Trio GEF1 to interact with other proteins (e.g., filamin, TrkA) through its PH domain may contribute to its cellular localization, thus explaining why its Rho substrates have similar but not identical phenotypes.	2

Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	Following determination of NMR structures of PH domains from pleckstrin and beta-spectrin, and the efforts of many laboratories to identify protein targets for these small domains, Harlan et al. reported that the N-terminal PH domain from pleckstrin can bind to the phosphoinositide PtdIns(4,5)P2.	2.5
Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	A central challenge in understanding the majority of PH domains to establish whether the very low affinity phosphoinositide binding reported in many cases has any functional relevance.	2
PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane.	Thus, while phosphoinositides that have a pair of vicinal phosphates appear to be targeted by PH domains that bind to them primarily through interactions with the inositol phosphate headgroup, other phosphoinositides are recognized by quite different groups of domains that utilize a combination of membrane-targeting mechanisms for their association with bilayers containing PtdIns3P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, for example.	3
PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane.	It has since become clear that PH domains in this group specifically recognize PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (and/or PtdIns(3,4)P2), and do so through interactions that are closely related to those first seen for PLCdelta-PH/PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding.	3.5
This allows for fine tuning of peptides released by a single secretory cell type with impaired signaling leading to pathological states.	Impaired signaling leading to increased Kalirin/Trio RhoGEF activity could contribute to the development of pathological states.	4

Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains.

However, PH domains remain the primary domain class with specificity and high affinity for phosphoinositides with two vicinal phosphates in their headgroup.	1
A few display strong specificity in lipid binding.	A crystal structure of the p40phox PX domain bound to dibutanoyl-PtdIns3P indicated that direct van der Waals interactions are also made between the PX domain and the glycerol backbone of the phospholipid, involving a 'membrane interaction loop' that NMR and monolayer studies further suggest to penetrate the lipid bilayer to enhance binding to PtdIns3P in membranes.	1.5
A few display strong specificity in lipid binding.	Although FAPP1's PH domain was identified in lipid overlay studies as a PtdIns4P-specific PH domain, this specificity is not apparent with other approaches (Keleti and Lemmon, unpublished).	2

It binds only to the active, NEDD8- or Rub1-modified form of cullins.	Instead, it relies on the UIM motif in UBXN7 that directly engages the NEDD8 modification on cullins.	4.5
It binds only to the active, NEDD8- or Rub1-modified form of cullins.	In vitro, UBXN7 can interact with non-neddylated cullins suggesting that UIM-NEDD8 may not be the only link between UBXN7 and CRLs.	3
Either UBA or UIM could serve as a docking site for neddylated-cullins.	Furthermore, several observations support the notion that neddylation is necessary for UBXN7 interaction with cullins: (1) CUL2 mutants defective to varying degrees in getting neddylated are similarly defective in UBXN7 binding; (2) chemical inhibition of the NEDD8-E1 abolishes the interaction of UBXN7 with multiple cullins; (3) in vitro neddylation of a CUL1-fragment stimulates its interaction with bacterially-expressed UBXN7, in a UIM-dependent manner.	3.5

Moreover, UBA-like domain is required for binding ubiquitylated-protein substrates, UIM motif is responsible for the binding to cullin RING ligases (CRLs), and UBX domain is essential for p97 binding.	Because UBXD7 has ubiquitin-binding UBA domain and UIM (Fig. 3a), it could be attracted to neddylated CRLs via their bound, ubiquitinated substrates.	3.5
Moreover, UBA-like domain is required for binding ubiquitylated-protein substrates, UIM motif is responsible for the binding to cullin RING ligases (CRLs), and UBX domain is essential for p97 binding.	With up to 240 complexes in human cells, CRLs constitute the largest group of ubiquitin E3 ligases, accounting for >40% of all ubiquitin ligases and ~20% of protein degradation via the proteasome . For p97 this could mean an expansion in potential ubiquitylated substrates that require its function for their degradation.	1
STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates.	However, a mutant in which a serine not followed by glutamine (S375) was replaced with alanine did not impair the G2/M checkpoint in response to IR (Figure 6D).	1

Bromodomains can interact specifically with acetylated lysine.	Bromodomains may serve a role analogous to the signal transduction SH2 domain, by providing a means to recruit remodeling complexes to acetylated chromatin regions or to allosterically modify their function post-recruitment.	2
Bromodomains can interact specifically with acetylated lysine.	Bromodomains, an extensive family of evolutionarily conserved protein modules originally found in proteins associated with chromatin and in nearly all nuclear histone acetyltransferases, have been recently discovered to function as acetyl-lysine binding domains.	4.5
Rsc1 and Rsc2 are components of the RSC complex (remodeling the structure of chromatin), are essential for transcriptional control, and have a specific domain architecture including two bromodomains.	Rsc1 and Rsc2 are alternative bromodomain-containing subunits of the ATP-dependent RSC chromatin remodeling complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	4
Rsc1 and Rsc2 are components of the RSC complex (remodeling the structure of chromatin), are essential for transcriptional control, and have a specific domain architecture including two bromodomains.	Both Rsc1 and Rsc2 are required to convert an inactive chromatin structure at mid-late gene promoters to active chromatin.	3.5
Bromodomains are 110 amino acid long domains, that are found in many chromatin associated proteins.	Certain protein domains, such as the bromodomains, are commonly associated with both of these classes of enzymes that alter chromatin.	4
Bromodomains are 110 amino acid long domains, that are found in many chromatin associated proteins.	Nearly all known histone-acetyltransferase (HAT)-associated transcriptional co-activators contain bromodomains, which are approximately 110-amino-acid modules found in many chromatin-associated proteins.	5
