It belongs to the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily which also includes the Bro1-like domains of mammalian Alix (apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein X), His-Domain type N23 protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP, also known as PTPN23), RhoA-binding proteins Rhophilin-1 and -2, Brox, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rim20 (also known as PalA), Ustilago maydis Rim23 (also known as PalC), and related domains.	In the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis, the ESCRT-interacting complex (Rim23/PalC Rim20/PalA, and Rim13/PalB) was conserved and required for Rim101/PacC activation.	2
It belongs to the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily which also includes the Bro1-like domains of mammalian Alix (apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein X), His-Domain type N23 protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP, also known as PTPN23), RhoA-binding proteins Rhophilin-1 and -2, Brox, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rim20 (also known as PalA), Ustilago maydis Rim23 (also known as PalC), and related domains.	While the sigma-1 receptor has no sequence homology to any existing mammalian proteins, it shares 30.3% sequence identity and 66.4% similarity to ERG2, a fungal gene encoding a C8-C7 sterol isomerase from Magnaporthe grisea, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Ustilago maydis.	1
RIM20, and some other members of the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily including Alix, also have a V-shaped (V) domain.	Given the endosomal localization of Bro1 domain proteins Alix and Rim20, inferences from previous deletion analyses of Alix and Rim20, and the conservation of most residues in the surface identified as the Bro1 binding site for Snf7, it is reasonable to infer that the Bro1 domain is a conserved ESCRT-III targeting domain.	1.5
RIM20, and some other members of the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily including Alix, also have a V-shaped (V) domain.	Similarly, MBP-Rim101-C bound to Rim20 V but did not bind to Bro1 V or Alix V.	2.5
Bro1-like domains bind components of the ESCRT-III complex: Snf7 in the case of Bro1.	Bro1 was also found to interact in the mbSUS with the ESCRT-III complex component Snf7 (Fig. 1B), a result also obtained using various other experimental approaches.	4
Bro1-like domains bind components of the ESCRT-III complex: Snf7 in the case of Bro1.	Recruitment of ALIX/Bro1 to MVBs/PVCs occurs via interaction of their Bro1 domains with ESCRT-III complex components Vps32/Snf7 and CHMP4, in yeast and mammals, respectively.	4.5

Alix, HD-PTP, Brox, Bro1, Rim20, and Rim23, interact with the ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) system.	The three canonical L-domains, P(T/S)AP, and PPXY, facilitate viral interactions with the cellular endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins by binding either mammalian ESCRT-I protein TSG101 (yeast homolog Vps23), ESCRT-associated protein ALIX (yeast homolog Bro1), or the WW domains of Nedd4 (yeast homolog Rsp5) family ubiquitin ligases, respectively (reviewed in).	2.5
The Alix V-domain is also a dimerization domain.	ALIX harbors a ubiquitin-binding domain within the central V-domain, and ubiquitination of ALIX may regulate its dimerization.	4.5
The Alix V-domain is also a dimerization domain.	We also examined whether the ALIX V domain is required for association with PAR1.	2.5
This family contains the N-terminal, Bro1-like domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bro1 and related proteins.

Bro1 participates in endosomal trafficking.	We suggest that some of the numerous Bro1-domain proteins in a higher eukaryotic cell may undergo regulated endosome association, that this association may govern their activities, and that their endosomal association may not reflect a direct role in endosome trafficking but, rather, that endosome properties feature a signal that ultimately alters activity of a Bro1-domain protein's downstream effector.	4.5
Bro1 participates in endosomal trafficking.	Prior studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that its two Bro1 domain proteins, membrane trafficking component Bro1 and alkaline pH signaling protein Rim20, require Snf7 interaction and endosomal localization for function.	4

The RGS domain is an essential part of the GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinases 2) and the GRK3 proteins, which are members of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases subfamily.	Furthermore, GPRK1, but not GPRK2, contains a C-terminal PH domain (Fig. 9B), which is also found in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases (GRK2 and GRK3) and the squid and octopus RKs.	3.5
The RGS domain is an essential part of the GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinases 2) and the GRK3 proteins, which are members of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases subfamily.	There are seven subtypes of GRKs (GRK1-7) that have been identified to date, which are subdivided into three classes based on the sequence homology: rhodopsin kinases subfamily (GRK1 and GRK7), the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases subfamily (GRK2/GRK3), and the GRK4 subfamily (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6).	4

GRK2 and GRK3 are members of the GRK kinase family which includes three major subfamilies: the GRK4 subfamily (GRK4, GRK5 and GRK6), the rhodopsin kinase or visual GRK subfamily (GRK1 and GRK7), and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinases subfamily (GRK2/GRK3).	On the basis of structural and functional similarities, the six known members of the GRK family have been divided into three subfamilies: (i) rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), (ii) the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) kinase subfamily (GRK2 and GRK3), and (iii) The GRK4 subfamily (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6) (reviewed refs. and).	5

The RGS domain of the GRKs has very little sequence similarity with the canonical RGS domain of the RGS proteins and therefore is often refered to as the RH (RGS Homology) domain.	One interesting structural feature of GRKs is an RGS homology domain at the N-terminus of these proteins.	4
The RGS domain of the GRKs has very little sequence similarity with the canonical RGS domain of the RGS proteins and therefore is often refered to as the RH (RGS Homology) domain.	For all GRKs, the enzyme's kinase domain is inserted within an 'RH domain' (RGS homology domain), so-called because of its homology to regulator of G-protein signalling proteins (see top of figure 10).	3.5
N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in the protection and stability of proteins.	A prediction suggested by the conserved network is that N-terminal acetylation of one or more proteins might be critical for efficient DNA replication in eukaryotes.	2.5
N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a widespread and highly conserved process that is involved in the protection and stability of proteins.	The initial residue of the histone H2A N termini of many organisms, including Tetrahymena, can be blocked by N-terminal acetylation, a conserved process that adds an acetyl group to the first amino acid of many histone and nonhistone proteins.	4
Strong expression of the human gene and its mouse ortholog Acy1 in brain, liver, and kidney suggest a role of the enzyme in amino acid metabolism of these organs.	Liver, muscle, intestine, brain and kidney are organs with significant amino acid metabolism, while muscle is the main organ for storage.	1
Strong expression of the human gene and its mouse ortholog Acy1 in brain, liver, and kidney suggest a role of the enzyme in amino acid metabolism of these organs.	ACY1 is also highly expressed in brain and liver, and to a lesser extent in almost all the other tissues (Cook et al.; Sass et al.), suggesting a pivotal role of the enzyme in amino acid metabolism of these organs.	4.5
Peptidase M20 family, Aminoacyclase-1 YxeP-like subfamily including YxeP, YtnL, YjiB and HipO2, most of which have not been well characterized to date.	This observation, primarily based on the B. subtilis YXEP structure, was proposed to distinguish enzymes of the M20D family from the other M20 proteases, which have an aspartate residue with an equivalent role and position (Lundgren et al., 2007; Lindner et al., 2003).	2.5
Peptidase M20 family, Aminoacyclase-1 YxeP-like subfamily including YxeP, YtnL, YjiB and HipO2, most of which have not been well characterized to date.	For example, in brain cancer, because of the alternative splicing and deletion of domain of the peptidase m20 family member, the aminoacylase-1 gene (ACY1) was spliced to produce a brain cancer-specific transcript (Figure 1a), and alternative splicing occurs in the SRP19 gene to produce a breast cancer-specific transcript by an alternative deletion of exon 3 (Figure 1b).	2.5
Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity; substrates include indoleacetic acid (IAA) N-conjugates of amino acids, N-acetyl-L-amino acids and aminobenzoylglutamate.	Aminoacylase-1 removes the acyl group, making the amino acid available for protein synthesis and other metabolic roles, and acts specifically on mercapturic acids (S-conjugates of N-acetyl-L-cysteine) and neutral aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids.	3
Several types of aminoacylases can be distinguished on the basis of substrate specificity; substrates include indoleacetic acid (IAA) N-conjugates of amino acids, N-acetyl-L-amino acids and aminobenzoylglutamate.

ACY1 breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group.	Preferred substrates of ACY1 are aliphatic amino acids with a short-chain acyl moiety, especially N-acetyl-methionine (Birnbaum et al.).	4.5
ACY1 breaks down cytosolic aliphatic N-acyl-alpha-amino acids (except L-aspartate), especially N-acetyl-methionine and acetyl-glutamate into L-amino acids and an acyl group.	Rest of the important genes such as N-acyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.14), N-acetyl-L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1), glutamine synthetase type I (EC 6.3.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) and ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) were also subjected to BLAST analysis to understand the regulation of biosynthetic pathways for various amino acids and polyamine metabolites in L. amylovorus starins (Additional file 1: Figure S3; Figure S4; Figure S5).	1

However, ACY1 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, the synthesis of acetylated amino acids.	Besides that, the strain Prevotella intermedia ZT possesses some enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of amino acid from other amino acid and immediate metabolite: 1) the glycine hydroxymethyltransferase that transform glycine to serine and also the reverse reaction, 2) saccharopine dehydrogenase that degrades saccharopine into lysine, 3) L-asparaginase that transforms asparagines to aspartic acid and 4) branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase that catalyzes the reversible transformation of va ***shortened***	1
ACY1 appears to physically interact with Sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1) and may influence its physiological functions; SphK1 and its product sphingosine	1	phosphate have been shown to promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells.	DMS can inhibit the activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), resulting in an increase in ceramide levels and a decrease in sphingosine	1	phosphate (S1P) levels within the cell events involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis.	3
ACY1 appears to physically interact with Sphingosine kinase type 1 (SphK1) and may influence its physiological functions; SphK1 and its product sphingosine	1	phosphate have been shown to promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells.	ACY1 regulates the subcellular localization of sphingosine kinase type 1 and, thereby, its product sphingosine	1	phosphate, promotes cell growth and inhibits apoptosis of tumor cells.	4.5
ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as in the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine).	In particular, S-nitrosothiols based on a single un-substituted amino acid, such as CysNO and S-nitrosohomocysteine, but not small peptides (S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitrosocysteinyl glycine) or substituted amino acids (S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine, S-nitroso-N-acetyl cysteine), are ligands for the L-AT and are avidly taken up by cells in culture.	1
ACY1 may also play a role in xenobiotic bioactivation as well as in the inter-organ processing of amino acid-conjugated xenobiotic derivatives (S-substituted-N-acetyl-L-cysteine).	Glycerrhetinic acid (GA) (5 muM), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (10 mM), and polyethylene glycol polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEG)-catalase (100 U/mL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).	1
ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates the tyrosine residues within TBSMs of raft-associated LAT, allowing the recruitment of other signaling molecules possessing SH2 domains or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains including Gads, Grb2, PLCgamma1 at the membrane proximal sites.	2.5
ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	As in Zap-70, the phosphotyrosine binding pockets of the two Syk SH2 domains are located in non occluded areas of the molecule and therefore are fully accessible for recognition and binding to the phosphorylated ITAM sequences (Fig. 3B).	3.5
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	This association is mediated by an interaction of the SH2 domains of Syk with the ITAM phosphotyrosines and leads to the activation of the Syk kinase, suggesting that Syk may be an important signal transducer of the BCR.	3
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	Recruitment of Syk to ITAM domains depends on the binding of its SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosines within the ITAM.	3
ZAP-70 and Syk comprise a family of hematopoietic cell specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are required for antigen and antibody receptor function.	Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR engagement are the activation of several non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), including p55blk (Blk), p59fyn (Fyn) and p53/56lyn (Lyn) of the Src family, Btk of the Itk/Tec family] and p72Syk (Syk) of the Syk/ZAP-70 family [.	3
ZAP-70 and Syk comprise a family of hematopoietic cell specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are required for antigen and antibody receptor function.	T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement results in sequential activation of the Src protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) Lck and Fyn and the Syk PTKs, ZAP-70 and Syk.	3
They are required for the proper development of T and B cells, immune receptors, and activating NK cells.	We use these surfaces to stimulate both T cells and NK cells, investigating how spacing affects signaling from two paradigmatic immune receptors: the TCR and the activating NK cell receptor CD16.	1
They are required for the proper development of T and B cells, immune receptors, and activating NK cells.	While HLA-G binds to the inhibitory receptors ILT2, ILT4 and KIR2DL4, HLA-E is the major ligand for the inhibitory NK cell receptor CD94/NKG2A,- B and for the activating -C expressed on NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) resulting in a reduced immune effector cell mediated cytotoxicity.	1
In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction.	Because most SH2 domains are involved in cellular signal transduction, the identification of signaling proteins that bind to SH2 domains may have a greater potential to be physiologically relevant.	4.5
In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction.	Our current analysis has validated 4 proteins with adapter function and SH2 domains, which typically mediate protein-protein interactions involved in signal transduction.	4
They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.	Although the C-terminal halves of Cbl and Cbl-b are less homologous, several functionally important binding sites are conserved in the two proteins, including proline-rich motifs that bind the SH3 domains of Grb2, Src, and CIN85 and tyrosine residues that form binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins when phosphorylated by various tyrosine kinases after the stimulation of a diverse array of cell surface receptors.	2
They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.	Structural studies performed with the Src kinase determined that SH2 domains have two binding surfaces and consequently bind simultaneously to a phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) and to motifs containing specific residues located C-terminal to the pTyr (residues +1 to +5).	5
This model contains the C-terminus SH2 domains of Syk.	These results imply that this non-canonical ITAM motif at SHP-2 C-terminus is required for the binding to the SH2 domains of Syk.	3
This model contains the C-terminus SH2 domains of Syk.	The Syk kinase has two tandem SH2 domains, a linker domain, and at its C terminus, a catalytic domain.	3.5
In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	In addition, a Lys residue occurs at this position in all other SH2 domains that bind the doubly phosphorylated form of Syk at Y342 and Y346, and thus this interaction appears to be a key recognition determinant for phosphotyrosine binding the specificity pocket of SH2 domains.	3
In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	A minimal mutation in the SH2 domains of Syk that abrogated phosphotyrosine binding was predicted, therefore, to interfere with ITAM-dependent signaling without affecting integrin signaling.	3
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	The Jak SH2 domain has been shown to be necessary for receptor interaction and Jak activation, but it is not believed to maintain the phosphotyrosine-binding function of classical SH2 domains.	1
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	The SH2 domains are in bold.	1.5
ZAP-70 is expressed in T and natural killer (NK) cells and Syk is expressed in B cells, mast cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, macrophages, and immature T cells.	Whereas Zap-70 expresses in T and NK cells, Syk regulates signalling in B cells, mast cells, neutrophils and macrophages.	5

Phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues within the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAM; consensus sequence Yxx[LI]x(7,8)Yxx[LI]) by the Src-family PTKs is required for efficient interaction of ZAP-70 and Syk with the receptor subunits and for receptor function.	Phosphorylation of a given receptor on on critical tyrosine residues (referred to as immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs orITAMs) leads to the recruitment of Syk and/or Zap-70; by virtue of their tandem src homology (SH) 2 domains.	4
Phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues within the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAM; consensus sequence Yxx[LI]x(7,8)Yxx[LI]) by the Src-family PTKs is required for efficient interaction of ZAP-70 and Syk with the receptor subunits and for receptor function.	Phosphorylation of receptor subunits on specific tyrosine residues termed immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs (ITAMs) by SRC family PTKs recruits spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) family of PTKs by virtue of their tandem SRC homology 2 domains.	4
They consist of two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain separated from the SH2 domains by a linker or hinge region.	Both ZAP-70 and Syk have tandemly arranged amino (N)-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains that are separated from their carboxy (C)-terminal catalytic domain by a hinge domain.	5
They consist of two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain separated from the SH2 domains by a linker or hinge region.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) comprise a family of enzymes that catalyze the coupling of amino acids with their matching tRNAs.	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are essential enzymes that catalyze the attachment of amino acids to corresponding tRNAs.	5
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) comprise a family of enzymes that catalyze the coupling of amino acids with their matching tRNAs.	Charged tRNAs or aminoacyl-tRNAs are produced by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), a family of enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent esterification of amino acids to the 3' acceptor end of cognate tRNAs (Ibba and Soll,).	4.5
This involves the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate using ATP, followed by the transfer of the activated amino acid to the 3'-adenosine moiety of the tRNA.	The first step, which requires ATP and Mg2+ ions, leads to the formation of an enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate and is followed by the transfer of the amino acid to the 3' end of the tRNA to form an aminoacyl-tRNA.	3
This involves the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate using ATP, followed by the transfer of the activated amino acid to the 3'-adenosine moiety of the tRNA.	The reaction proceeds through a two-step mechanism in which an aminoacyl-adenylate is formed through condensation of the amino acid with ATP followed by transfer of the amino acid to the terminal adenosine moiety of the corresponding tRNA.	4.5

It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	Thus, our observations are consistent with the idea that eIF2 bridges eIF5 and eIF2B, forming an eIF2B/eIF2/eIF5 complex in hc eIF5 cells.	3.5
It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	Two of these - eIF5 and eIF2B - constitute a regulatory circuit that cycles eIF2 between its active state (in which it is bound to GTP) and an inactive state (bound to GDP) that cannot initiate translation.	4
It is closely related to SelB, the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor from eubacteria.	Also, in order to engineer a translation system that can incorporate Sep into growing polypeptides, the EF-Tu binding pocket will need to be mutated, possibly requiring the creation of a Sep-specific EF-Tu analogous to SelB, the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor.	2
It is closely related to SelB, the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor from eubacteria.	These domains take their name from the bacterial selenocysteine-specific elongation factor, which is encoded by the SelB gene.	2
The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	For translation initiation in normal cells, eIF2, an oligomer composed of three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), interacts with GTP and the initiator methionyl-tRNA to form a ternary complex of eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA that subsequently binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit of the ribosome.	5
The GTP-bound gamma subunit also binds initiator methionyl-tRNA and delivers it to the 40S ribosomal subunit.	In its active GTP-bound state, eIF2 binds the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), forming the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAiMet ternary complex, and delivers the Met-tRNAiMet to the 40S ribosomal subunit (reviewed in reference).	4.5
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	Analogous to EF1A-catalyzed binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during elongation, initiation factor 2 (IF2) in bacteria and eukaryotic IF2 (eIF2) in eukaryotes bind the initiator Met-tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit in the first step of translation initiation (reviewed in ref.).	3
The translational factor components of the ternary complex, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes are not the same protein (despite their unfortunately similar names).	The protein promotes 43S complex formation by stabilizing the binding of the ternary complex eIF2-GTP-methionyl-initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA) to the 40S subunit and, together with other translation initiation factor is involved in a sophisticated scanning system responsible for accurately locating the proper start codon on the mRNA in eukaryotes.	2
Both eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon are known to bind strongly to eIF2-beta, but have also been shown to bind directly to eIF2-gamma.	We also find that three lysine-rich boxes in the N-terminal segment of eIF2beta mediate the binding of eIF2 to both eIF5 and eIF2B.	3
Both eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon are known to bind strongly to eIF2-beta, but have also been shown to bind directly to eIF2-gamma.	However, the fact that eIF5 and eIF2Be bind the same site of eIF2 (eIF2beta K-boxes) and that eIF5 can interact with equal affinity to eIF2 GDP, eIF2 GTP, or TC in vitro (CR Singh and K Asano, unpublished data) provides a potential conundrum for cells, as eIF5/eIF2 GDP complexes could be antagonistic to the function of the GEF eIF2B.	4
The gamma subunit has no intrinsic GTPase activity, but is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and GDP/GTP exchange is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. eIF2B is a heteropentamer, and the epsilon chain binds eIF2.	Two proteins regulate its G-protein cycle: eIF5 has both GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) functions, and eIF2B is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF).	3.5
The gamma subunit has no intrinsic GTPase activity, but is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and GDP/GTP exchange is stimulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. eIF2B is a heteropentamer, and the epsilon chain binds eIF2.	Moreover, mutating the K-boxes in eIF2beta impairs the binding of isolated eIF2beta, as well as the eIF2 complex, with both the eIF2 GTPase stimulatory factor eIF5 and the catalytic epsilon-subunit of the eIF2 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B.	3
eIF2 is a heterotrimeric translation initiation factor that consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.	As a heterotrimeric protein, eIF2 (comprised of individually distinct alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits) binds GDP and subsequently Met-tRNAi following GDP-GTP exchange via the heteropentameric initiation factor, eIF2B.	5
eIF2 is a heterotrimeric translation initiation factor that consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits.	In both archaea and eukaryotes the heterotrimeric initiation factor a/eIF2 is comprised of the three subunits alpha, beta and gamma, which are all orthologs between the two domains.	5
Following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, eIF2:GDP is released from the ribosome.	After the scanning ribosome selects a start codon for protein synthesis, hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 is completed and eIF2-GDP is released from the ribosome.	4.5
Following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, eIF2:GDP is released from the ribosome.	Upon AUG recognition, the GTPase-activating protein eIF5 stimulates hydrolysis of GTP in the TC, with release of eIF2-GDP and other factors from the ribosome.	3.5
Both factors are GTPases; however, eubacterial IF-2 is a single polypeptide, while eIF2 is heterotrimeric.	Translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a heterotrimeric protein that transfers methionyl-initiator tRNAMet to the small ribosomal subunit in a ternary complex with GTP.	4
Both factors are GTPases; however, eubacterial IF-2 is a single polypeptide, while eIF2 is heterotrimeric.	eIF2 is a heterotrimeric protein complex, which binds initiating methionyl transfer RNA and the 40S ribosomal subunit to start nascent polypeptide synthesis.	3.5

eIF2-gamma is found only in eukaryotes and archaea.	Thus, in the context of the above idea, one can imagine that, either in eukaryotes or in archaea, e/aIF1 release would be sufficient to trigger rearrangement of the full eIF2 structure.	2
eIF2-gamma is found only in eukaryotes and archaea.	Several non-universal but broadly distributed trGTPases from bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes (both cytoplasmic and organellar) have been characterized experimentally and shown to have important roles in translation and its regulation, examples being peptide release factors RF3 and eRF3 and initiation factor a/eIF2-gamma.	2.5
eIF2-gamma is a member of the same family as eubacterial IF2, but the two proteins are only distantly related.	The archaea/eukarya recruited another tRNA-binding GTPase, the gamma subunit of a/eIF2, to interact with Met-tRNA, while retaining the IF2-like factor to stabilize the tRNAi in the P site and facilitate the joining of the ribosomal subunits.	2.5
eIF2-gamma is a member of the same family as eubacterial IF2, but the two proteins are only distantly related.	However, in the eukarya the Met-tRNAi binding factor is the trimeric protein eIF2, none of whose subunits is related to bacterial IF2.	3.5

The general function of the SOCS box is the recruitment of the ubiquitin-transferase system.	The SOCS box interacts with components of the ubiquitin ligase machinery (Elongin B, Elongin C, Cullin-5, and Ring-box 2, and an E2 ubiquitin transferase), thereby mediating proteosomal degradation of associated target proteins, such as JAKs.	3.5
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.	The SB has been shown to interact with elongins B and C, which mediate recruitment of Cullin-5 and Rbx-1 to form an E3 ligase complex.	3
The SOCS box interacts with Elongins B and C, Cullin-5 or Cullin-2, Rbx-1, and E2.

This subfamily corresponds to the RRM of Acinus, a caspase	3	activated nuclear factor that induces apoptotic chromatin condensation after cleavage by caspase-3 without inducing DNA fragmentation.	Hallmarks of apoptosis are largely observed through the caspase-3 cleavage of Rho effector protein (ROCK 1), apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer in the nucleus (acinus), nuclear lamin proteins, and caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as well as many other proteins, which leads to membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation.	2.5

CuNIR contains at least one type 1 copper center and a type 2 copper center in the protein.	Copper nitrate reductase, CuNiR, contains a type 2 copper binding site where copper, not unlike Zn(II) in CA, is coordinated to three histidine residues and an exogenous water molecule.	4.5
CuNIR contains at least one type 1 copper center and a type 2 copper center in the protein.	Extensive structural studies have shown that each CuNiR monomer contains two copper sites: one type 1 copper (T1Cu) site and one type 2 copper (T2Cu) catalytic site (Godden et al., 1991).	5
The type 2 copper center of a copper nitrite reductase is the active site of the enzyme.	We demonstrate using a highly modular 3-stranded Coiled Coil (TRI-peptide system) that a functional type 2 copper center exhibiting copper nitrite reductase (NiR) activity exhibits the highest homogeneous catalytic efficiency under aqueous conditions for the reduction of nitrite to NO and H2O.	4
A Cys-His bridge plays an important role in facilitating rapid electron transfer from the type 1 center to the type 2 center.	The reduced Fe2+ ion plays an important role in compensating for the charge imbalance and also mediates the electron transfer between MR-1 and X2+.	1
A Cys-His bridge plays an important role in facilitating rapid electron transfer from the type 1 center to the type 2 center.	The average electron transfer number, 1.79-1.92 and 2.55-3.8 for Co-Pi and rGO-Co-Pi, respectively, suggests that 2-electron reduction pathway plays an important role in the reduction of oxygen for both the two materials.	1
A histidine, bound to the Type 2 Cu center, is responsible for binding and reducing nitrite.	It possesses conserved ligands to the type 1 (T1) copper center, which is responsible for oxidizing proteinaceous electron donors, and to the type 2 (T2) copper center, which is the site of nitrite binding and reduction.	3.5
A histidine, bound to the Type 2 Cu center, is responsible for binding and reducing nitrite.	The Hill coefficient of 2.2 observed for binding of Cu(II) to the four-histidine peptide PrP(58-91) reflects the sharp cooperative transition between fully bound copper at pH 7.4 and above and no copper binding below pH 6.	1.5
Copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNIR), which catalyzes the reduction of NO2- to NO, is the key enzyme in the denitrification process in denitrifying bacteria.	The reduction of NO2- to toxic nitric oxide (NO2- + 2H+ + e- NO + H2O) is referred to as the key step in denitrification and catalyzed by either cd1-heme nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) or copper nitrite reductase (CuNiR).	4.5
Copper-containing nitrite reductase (CuNIR), which catalyzes the reduction of NO2- to NO, is the key enzyme in the denitrification process in denitrifying bacteria.

The UPR is initiated by the ER-resident protein kinase and endonuclease IRE1, which promotes non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, facilitating its translation.	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the UPR activation involves (i) aggregation of the ER-resident kinase/RNase Ire1 to form an Ire1 focus, (ii) targeting HAC1 pre-mRNA toward the Ire1 focus that cleaves out an inhibitory intron from the mRNA, and (iii) translation of Hac1 protein from the spliced mRNA.	5
The UPR is initiated by the ER-resident protein kinase and endonuclease IRE1, which promotes non-conventional splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, facilitating its translation.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae UPR, a highly conserved program in eukaryotes, the ER transmembrane kinase-endonuclease Ire1 activates this response via non-canonical splicing of a transcription factor encoding RNA, HAC1.	5
The bZIP structural motif contains a basic region and a leucine zipper, composed of alpha helices with leucine residues 7 amino acids apart, which stabilize dimerization with a parallel leucine zipper domain.	The name bZIP describes two juxtaposed regions: the basic region is rich in basic amino acids; the other contains leucine residues localized at every seven positions so that, through an alpha-helix structure, they create a hydrophobic leucine-enriched surface that mediates dimerization by resembling a zipper (leucine zipper).	5
The bZIP structural motif contains a basic region and a leucine zipper, composed of alpha helices with leucine residues 7 amino acids apart, which stabilize dimerization with a parallel leucine zipper domain.	G13 contains a bZIP motif, a region rich in basic amino acids adjacent to a coiled-coil leucine zipper domain, common to this class of proteins that is known to be involved in dimerization and DNA binding.	3
HAC1 (also called Hac1p or HacA) is a bZIP transcription factor that plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR).	Notably, HAC1 encodes the key transcription factor (Hac1p) implicated in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is triggered in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.	4
HAC1 (also called Hac1p or HacA) is a bZIP transcription factor that plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR).	Hac1u is not a favorable mRNA for protein translation, but after splicing Hac1i is translated very efficiently, and its product, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor Hac1p activates transcription of the UPR target genes by binding to the unfolded protein response element (UPRE).	4
HAC1 binds to and activates promoters of genes that encode chaperones and other targets of the UPR.	The protein encoded by spliced HAC1 mRNA binds and activates transcription from the UPR element [UPRE, minimal motif TGACGTG(C/A)] upstream of many UPR target genes.	4.5
HAC1 binds to and activates promoters of genes that encode chaperones and other targets of the UPR.	When Hac1 is efficiently translated, it binds to the unfolded protein response element in the promoters of ER chaperones and other UPR targets and up-regulates their transcription.	5
Dimerization of leucine zippers creates a pair of the adjacent basic regions that bind DNA and undergo conformational change.	Furthermore, a variety of tests have shown that both the recombinant and the natural mTERF bind to DNA as a monomer, arguing against a dimerization role for the leucine zippers, and rather pointing, together with the results of mutagenesis experiments, to intramolecular leucine zipper interactions being required to bring the two basic domains in close register with the mTERF target DNA sequence.	2
Dimerization of leucine zippers creates a pair of the adjacent basic regions that bind DNA and undergo conformational change.	We expect two types of specificity of bZip dimerization: (1) the first type would be determined solely by the coiled-coil interaction of the two leucine zippers; (2) the second type represents dimerization in the presence of the cognate DNA element, which depends on the conformation of both the zipper and the adjacent basic region responsible for contacting the DNA.	4.5
Dimerization occurs in a specific and predictable manner resulting in hundreds of dimers having unique effects on transcription.	It may also suggest that the dimerization of C-terminal domains of RF2a and RF2b may provide a different molecular scaffold for interactions with different cofactors and/or general transcription factors that result in different specific functions of the homo- and hetero-dimers of the C-terminal domains.	2
Dimerization occurs in a specific and predictable manner resulting in hundreds of dimers having unique effects on transcription.	(A) Phosphorylation of IRF3 leads to its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where IRF3 dimers ultimately stimulate transcription of genes under the control of the IFN-alpha/beta promoter, resulting in the production of IFN-alpha/beta.	1

The number and variety of host proteins with PH motifs is large but most of them can be grouped by function into a few classes: Ser/Thr protein kinases, Tyr protein kinases, small G-protein regulators, endocytic GTPases, adaptors, phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes, and cytoskeletal associated proteins (Rebecchi and Scarlata,).	5
RhoGEFs, Kalirin and Trio, the mammalian homologs of Drosophila Trio and Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-73 regulate a novel step in secretory granule maturation.	Other RhoGEFs that have been demonstrated to have important roles in neural development include Kalirin and Trio, the vertebrate orthologues of Unc-73/Drosophila trio.	2.5
RhoGEFs, Kalirin and Trio, the mammalian homologs of Drosophila Trio and Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-73 regulate a novel step in secretory granule maturation.	Much of our understanding of the role of dual Rho GEFs comes from studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster; Unc-73 and dTrio, orthologues of Kalrn and Trio, the only other mammalian dual Rho GEFs, encode proteins equivalent to Kal9, but do not encode a protein kinase domain.	2.5
The first RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette catalyzes exchange on Rac1 and RhoG while the second RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette is specific for RhoA.	Trio and UNC-73 are large proteins closely related to Kalirin that possess numerous domains including a Sec14p domain, multiple spectrin-like repeats, an SH3 domain, and two DH-PH Rho GEF domains (RhoGEF-1 specific for Rac1/RhoG and RhoGEF-2 specific for RhoA) (Fig. 3).	5
The first RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette catalyzes exchange on Rac1 and RhoG while the second RhoGEF(DH)/PH cassette is specific for RhoA.	For example, the DH domains of both LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF exchange less efficiently on RhoA than their respective DH/PH cassette.	2.5

Kalirin and Trio are closely related to p63RhoGEF and have PH domains of similar function.	(D) TrkA binds specifically to the N-terminal PH domains of Kalirin and Trio.	1.5
Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	However, a subset of PH domains have been shown to bind phosphoinositide head groups with sufficient affinity and specificity to provide the driving force for membrane localization.	3.5
Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity.	PH domains are best known for their ability to bind phosphoinositides with high affinity and specificity, although it is now clear that less than 10% of all PH domains share this property.	5
PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane.	To further substantiate this assumption, we fused two different heterologous membrane-binding domains to the C terminus of GFP-LKB1DeltaLB C564A: The PH-domain of human phospholipase Cdelta (ref.) that preferentially binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (resulting in GFP-LKB1DeltaLB C564A-PH(PLCdelta)), but is also capable of binding to PA with a high affinity, and the PH-domain of human Akt1, (GFP-LKB1DeltaLB C564A-PH(Akt1)) with a high affinity to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (ref.).	3
PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane.	Binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2 was more than two-fold weaker than binding to either PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, indicating that myo1e has some stereospecificity for phosphoinositides with a phosphate at the 4-position of the inositol ring, likely mediated by low affinity binding via the PH domain.	2.5
This allows for fine tuning of peptides released by a single secretory cell type with impaired signaling leading to pathological states.	The use of HBR may pave the way to novel combinatorial strategies of molecular and stem cell therapy based on fine tuning of targeted Smad transciption and signaling leading to a high-throughput of cardiogenesis without the needs of gene transfer technologies.	1
This allows for fine tuning of peptides released by a single secretory cell type with impaired signaling leading to pathological states.	Chronic immobilization stress by restraint has been found to alter the prooxidant-antioxidant balance, leading to the development of various pathological states such as mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of energy pathways, neuronal damage, impaired neurogenesis and induction of signaling events in apoptotic cell death.	1
Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains.	In contrast to the p21 activated kinases, their serine/threonine kinase domain is present at the N-terminus of the protein and is followed by a poorly conserved sequence lacking CRIB or PH domains.	1
Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains.	The protein contains the conserved regions characteristic of other members of the eukaryotic PLD family: a Phox homology (PX) domain followed by a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, conserved catalytic domains (CR I-IV), a loop sequence, a PI(4,5)P2-interacting motif, and a conserved carboxy terminus [reviewed in ].	1

They share little sequence conservation, but all have a common fold, which is electrostatically polarized.	Although a comparison of all of these protein domains reveal relatively poor sequence identities (10-30%), they share a critical structural requirement: a cluster of basic residues facing toward the inner membrane surface producing an electrostatically polarized protein structure that contributes to energetically favorable interactions with phosphoinositides.	1
PH domains have diverse functions, but in general are involved in targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular location or in the interaction with a binding partner.	Moreover, we present data that Ca2+/CaM may be a general binding partner and potential regulator of other proteins with PH domains.	2.5

Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force.	Bold traces indicate the free-energy distribution of attached myosin heads at the isometric plateau: the force is larger at 10 C than at 2 C, because at 10 C in the range of x between 1 and 2.5 nm, the attached heads prefer the A2 state, which exhibits a steeper free-energy curve.	2
The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke).	The actinomyosin functional cycle is as follows: the myosin head binds ATP and this enables release from the actin filament, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, the myosin head domain binds actin when a site becomes available, the myosin head generates a power stroke that pushes the actin filament and simultaneously ADP and Pi are released, and myosin detaches from actin.	4

They form unique complexes consisting of one member of each subgroup, that mediate fusion between a specific type of vesicles and their target organelle.	A key feature of the SNARE hypothesis is that v-SNARE interacts with an appropriate t-SNARE to form organelle specific docking and fusion complexes, and that the specificity of these interactions ensures that transport vesicles fuse only with an appropriate acceptor membranes.	3.5

Upon the absorption of light, microbial rhodopsins undergo light-induced photoisomerization of all-trans retinal into the 13-cis isomer, whereas the photoisomerization of 11-cis retinal to all-trans isomer occurs in the animal rhodopsins.	Energy cycling in bacteriorhodopsin involves light (hupsilon) absorption which gives rise to photoisomerization of retinal from the all-trans configuration to the 13-cis isomer (Figures 2 and 3).	2.5
