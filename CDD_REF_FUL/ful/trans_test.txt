Bro1 acts as a modular scaffold: the N-terminal Bro1 domain interacts with Snf7 and tethers Bro1 to the endosome, where its C-terminal region recruits the ubiquitin protease Doa4 in proximity to ubiquitinated multivesicular body cargo.	4
Bro1-like domains are boomerang-shaped, and part of the domain is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like structure.	The predicted structure suggests the presence of four structural domains: a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a beta-propeller domain, a carboxypeptidase regulatory domain-like fold (CRD), and an OmpA-C-like putative peptidoglycan-binding domain.	1
Bro1-like domains are boomerang-shaped, and part of the domain is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like structure.	Structurally, they consist mainly of a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) -like helical solenoid, although the Bro1 domain is far larger than the MIT domain, at ~370 residues vs. ~90 residues for the MIT domain (Fig. 11).	4
It interacts with a YPxL motif in the Doa4 catalytic domain to stimulate its deubiquitination activity.	Consistent with this region of Bro1 binding to the YPxL motif in Doa4, cells expressing the bro1PSVF-AAAA allele were defective in deubiquitination and sorting of CPS (Figure 6C and D) and contained a predominance of small lumenal MVB vesicles (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Video S9).	4
It interacts with a YPxL motif in the Doa4 catalytic domain to stimulate its deubiquitination activity.	The Doa4 YPxL motif is necessary for cargo sorting and deubiquitination.	3

Alix and His domain protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP), mammalian Bro1 family proteins, bind YP(X)nL (n = 1 to 3) motifs in their target proteins through their V domains.	3
RIM20, and some other members of the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily including Alix, also have a V-shaped (V) domain.	Pfam lists 54 proteins containing this domain including Bro1, Alix, Rim20, Rhophilin, the protein tyrosine phosphatase HD-PTP, and Xp95, and their orthologs.	2
RIM20, and some other members of the BRO1-Alix-like superfamily including Alix, also have a V-shaped (V) domain.	Structural studies of ALIX's domains have suggested that the V-shaped middle domain of ALIX may bring the Bro1 domain and the PRD into proximity.	3.5
Bro1-like domains bind components of the ESCRT-III complex: Snf7 in the case of Bro1.	Bro1 belongs to a larger family of related proteins including mammalian Alix and HD-PTP, which share a common architecture, bind ESCRT-I, and have both an N-terminal Bro1 homology domain that binds the ESCRT-III subunit Snf7/CHMP4 and a middle V domain that, in the case of Alix binds YPxL peptides motifs.	5
Bro1-like domains bind components of the ESCRT-III complex: Snf7 in the case of Bro1.	The ESCRT-III complex recruits Bro1 and then Snf7 in yeast (Alix and Chmp4, respectively, in humans), providing a critical scission factor in the final step to forming cargo-containing intraluminal vesicles.	4
Alix, HD-PTP, Brox, Bro1, Rim20, and Rim23, interact with the ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) system.	Mechanistically, the C protein was shown to interact with the cellular Alix/AIP1 protein, a component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery.	2
Alix, HD-PTP, Brox, Bro1, Rim20, and Rim23, interact with the ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport) system.	Much of what is known about ALIX has stemmed from the characterization of its closest orthologue, yeast BRO1, a crucial component of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway.	3.5
The Alix V-domain is also a dimerization domain.	It is thus conceivable that truncated forms of ALIX which retain the V dimerization domain form heterodimers with endogenous ALIX.	4.5
The Alix V-domain is also a dimerization domain.	Oligomerization and dimerization of ALIX was observed previously, and we confirm that the V-domain is sufficient for dimerization.	5
This family contains the N-terminal, Bro1-like domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bro1 and related proteins.

RGS22 contains at least 3 copies of the RGS domain in vertebrata and exists in multiple splicing variants.	The N-terminal domain of most members of the PDE4 family contains the two upstream conserved regions UCR1 and UCR2 mentioned above; however several truncated variants of PDE4B and PDE4D are formed via alternate splicing resulting in deletions of part or all of UCR1 (Figure 3).	1

ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	To assess the impact of the R192W mutation on high-affinity binding of ZAP-70 to phosphorylated zeta-chain ITAMs, 293T cells (which lack endogenous expression of Lck and zeta-chain) were transiently transfected with Lck, FLAG-tagged-zeta chain, and a panel of ZAP-70 constructs, including WT, R192W, R360P, and R37K/R190K; the latter construct is known to abrogate phosphotyrosine binding of both N- and C-SH2 domains.	3
ZAP-70 forms two phosphotyrosine binding pockets, one of which is shared by both SH2 domains.	The most unusual feature of the ZAP-70 SH2 ITAM complex is that the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) pocket of the amino-terminal SH2 domain is formed by residues contributed from both the amino- and carboxy-terminal SH2 domains that are brought into juxtaposition by ITAM binding.	4
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	As binding sites for the SH2 (Src homology-2) domains, the phosphotyrosines generated in the ITAM sequences are important for the interaction of Fcgamma receptors with important signaling molecules such as the tyrosine kinase Syk, required for phagocytosis.	3
In addition, the two SH2 domains of Syk display flexibility in their relative orientation, allowing Syk to accommodate a greater variety of spacing sequences between the ITAM phosphotyrosines and singly phosphorylated non-classical ITAM ligands.	Structural analysis of Syk binding to a dually phosphorylated ITAM peptide revealed that the two SH2 domains of Syk act independently, each binding to one phosphotyrosine in the ITAM.	3
ZAP-70 and Syk comprise a family of hematopoietic cell specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are required for antigen and antibody receptor function.	Syk and ZAP-70 comprise a family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases that play critical roles in signaling pathways mediated through hematopoietic cell surface receptors, including TCRs.	4.5
ZAP-70 and Syk comprise a family of hematopoietic cell specific protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are required for antigen and antibody receptor function.	Stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) initiates a cascade of signal transduction events involving the activation of two families of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), Src PTKs and Syk/ZAP-70 PTKs.	3.5
They are required for the proper development of T and B cells, immune receptors, and activating NK cells.	NK cells do not express recombination-activating gene (RAG) proteins, which are necessary for recombination events that are required to generate a large repertoire of diverse antigen-specific receptors in T and B cells.	1
They are required for the proper development of T and B cells, immune receptors, and activating NK cells.	Intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation is an important process in initiating and maintaining activating signals of mammalian cells, especially stimulation of immune receptors such as BCR, TCR, and KIR that are expressed on B, T, and NK cells, respectively.	2.5
In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction.	The tyrosine phosphorylation of molecules with SH2 domains, including Lyn and Syk tyrosine kinases, leads to the activation of the adaptors and the enzymes involved in the cascade reactions of various signal transduction pathways.	4
In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction.	Together with a subset of PTB domains and few isolated other protein domains, the SH2 domains function to couple tyrosine phosphorylation to coordinate formation of multi-protein complexes involved in signal transduction.	4.5
They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.	These domains have different recognition motifs for their target ligands; for example, SH2 can recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated (pTyr) motifs, SH3 and WW can recognize proline-rich sequences containing PxxP or PPxY motifs, in which x denotes any amino acid, and PDZ domains can usually bind to 4~5 C-terminal amino acids of target proteins.	3.5
They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.	Mammalian ShcA docking proteins have amino-terminal phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding (PTB) and carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which recognize specific pTyr sites on activated receptors, and a central region with two phosphorylated tyrosine-X-asparagine (pYXN) motifs (where X represents any amino acid) that each bind the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) adaptor.	2

This model contains the C-terminus SH2 domains of Syk.	Syk is a 72 kDa nonreceptor type of tyrosine kinase consisting of two tandem repeat of Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and one C-terminus kinase domain.	3.5
In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	Pharmacological inhibition of Syk or mutations of the conserved tyrosine on CLEC-2 or the conserved arginines in the phosphotyrosine binding motifs in the Syk SH2 domains result in complete abrogation of CLEC-2 signalling, supporting a model in which Syk crosslinks two phosphorylated receptors.	2.5
In Syk the two SH2 domains do not form such a phosphotyrosine-binding site.	Upon phosphorylation of Tyr-130, which lies between the two SH2 domains distant to the phosphotyrosine binding sites, Syk dissociates from the receptor.	3
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	This structure suggests that the SH2 domains do not function independently, and that interactions between the domains are important for specific recognition of the phospho-ITAMs of the activated TCR.	2
The SH2 domains here are believed to function independently.	The SH2 domains may also confer intrinsic adaptor properties to Lck, as a potential kinase independent function.	1

It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.	Moreover, mutating the K-boxes in eIF2beta impairs the binding of isolated eIF2beta, as well as the eIF2 complex, with both the eIF2 GTPase stimulatory factor eIF5 and the catalytic epsilon-subunit of the eIF2 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B.	2.5
It is possible that eIF2-beta serves simply as a high-affinity docking site for eIF5 and eIF2B-epsilon, or that eIF2-beta serves a regulatory role.

S3 is part of the head region of the 30S ribosomal subunit and is believed to interact with mRNA as it threads its way from the latch into the channel.	Of particular interest is the large movement of the 30S latch (wide-open latch state):resulting in a gap of ~20A between helix 34 and the G530 region of the 30S subunit:that permits the loading of mRNA-like domain of tmRNA into the ribosomal mRNA entry channel.	2
S3 is part of the head region of the 30S ribosomal subunit and is believed to interact with mRNA as it threads its way from the latch into the channel.	In the translocation pathway (Fig. 1), the small conformational change in EF-G or small global rotational motion of EF-G relative to the ribosome in State H1 causes the tip of domain IV to move towards and interact with the decoding center in the 30S subunit, facilitating the large forward rotation of the 30S head relative to the 30S body; the forward 30S head rotation widens the mRNA channel (termed as ribosomal unlocking); the unlocking facilitates the reverse 30S subunit rotation, driving the ***shortened***	1

A Cys-His bridge plays an important role in facilitating rapid electron transfer from the type 1 center to the type 2 center.	The rate of reduction of the C242S mutant by NADH is some 7-fold slower than for the wild-type protein (68 s-1 versus 478 s-1), and KdNADH is somewhat larger (6 vs 3 muM), indicating that Cys 242 plays a modest role in facilitating electron transfer from NADH to the flavin but only a minimal role in binding of NADH to the enzyme.	1

On the basis of the position of three glutamine (Q) residues and one arginine (R) residue in the central layer of the four-helical SNARE bundle (0' layer), SNAREs are classified into four subfamilies: Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, and R-SNAREs.	5
SNARE proteins are classified into four groups, Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs, depending on whether the residue in the hydrophilic center layer of the four-helical bundle is a glutamine (Q) or arginine (R).	The ionic layer is formed by three glutamine residues (Q) and one arginine residue (R) from each of the SNARE motifs categorized as Qa, Qb, Qc, and R SNAREs (; Figure 1B).	4.5
The VAMP-7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7, also called synaptobrevin-like protein 1) protein belongs to the R-SNARE subgroup of SNAREs and interacts with syntaxin 7(Qa), syntaxin 8 (Qc) and Vti1b (Qb).	The Qa-SNARE protein syntaxin 7 (Stx7), which interacts with Q-SNAREs Vti1b and Stx8 and the R-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), regulates late endosome fusion.	1.5
The VAMP-7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7, also called synaptobrevin-like protein 1) protein belongs to the R-SNARE subgroup of SNAREs and interacts with syntaxin 7(Qa), syntaxin 8 (Qc) and Vti1b (Qb).	The synaptic vesicle-associated protein VAMP (synaptobrevin), as a v-SNAP receptor (SNARE), interacts with two target membrane-associated proteins (t-SNAREs), soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP)-25 and syntaxin, to form a stable SNARE complex.	1.5
The complex is involved in the transport from early endosomes to the lysosome via regulating the transport from multivesicular bodies to the lysosomes.	Endocytic vesicles transport ubiquitinated receptors from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, which are transformed to late endosomes/multivesicular bodies to finally fuse with the lysosome or vacuole.	1
The complex is involved in the transport from early endosomes to the lysosome via regulating the transport from multivesicular bodies to the lysosomes.	Intermediates involved in the transport from early to late endosomes are called endosomal carrier vesicles to multivesicular bodies (ECV-MVB), which selectively incorporate receptors destined for late endosomes or lysosomes.	1
Their SNARE motifs form twisted and parallel heterotetrameric helix bundles.	Sets of SNAREs generally build the core for the individual intracellular membrane fusion processes and zippering of such sets of SNAREs via their SNARE motifs into parallel four-helix coiled-coil bundles is regarded to provide the driving force for membrane fusion.	4
Their SNARE motifs form twisted and parallel heterotetrameric helix bundles.	Several lines of evidence indicate that specific sets of SNARE proteins form stable complexes through assembly of their SNARE motifs into parallel four-helix coiled-coil bundles.	4
The SNARE complex mediates membrane fusion, important for trafficking of newly synthesized proteins, recycling of pre-existing proteins and organelle formation.	During intracellular membrane trafficking, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (alpha-SNAP) disassemble the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex for recycling of the SNARE proteins.	1.5

(D) Human lymphoblasts were labeled with BrdU for 7 or 12 h, arrested in metaphase, and subjected to ReTiSH using a BAC probe (RP11-55G7) for the asynchronously replicating olfactory receptor (family 4) gene cluster on chromosome 14 (OR4).	1
ORs belong to the class A rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors and constitute the largest multigene family in mammals of approximately 1,000 genes.	The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily represents the largest class of mammalian cell surface receptors; approximately 1,000 genes (or 1% of the genome) encode members of this family.	3.5
ORs belong to the class A rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors and constitute the largest multigene family in mammals of approximately 1,000 genes.	The cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors (see Fig. 1) belong to the Class A (rhodopsin (Rho) family) of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).	2.5
More than 60% of human ORs are non-functional pseudogenes compared to only about 20% in mouse.	Around the same time, there was a massive loss of functional odorant receptor genes; ~30% or more of the olfactory receptors (ORs) are pseudogenes in apes and Old World monkeys, compared with only ~20% of ORs in most New World monkeys, lemur, and mouse.	3
Each OR can recognize structurally similar odorants, and a single odorant can be detected by several ORs.	With such a large number of different ORs, the olfactory system is capable to discriminate between ~10 000 different odors: one odorant can activate numerous types of ORs, while a single OR can be activated by several different odorants.	4.5
Each OR can recognize structurally similar odorants, and a single odorant can be detected by several ORs.	Sf21 cells with insect ORs act as odorant sensor elements; simply attaching them to extended-gate electrodes allowed the sensors to discriminate between two structurally similar odorants by electrical signals.	2.5
A consensus nomenclature system based on evolutionary divergence is used here to classify the olfactory receptor family.	Olfactory Receptor Multigene Family in Vertebrates: From the Viewpoint of Evolutionary Genomics	3.5
The nomenclature begins with the root name OR, followed by an integer representing a family, a letter denoting a subfamily, and an integer representing the individual gene within the subfamily.	The enzymes are named CYP for cytochrome P450, followed by an Arabic number denoting the family (more than 40% identity on the amino acid sequence level), a letter designating the subfamily (more than 55% identity) and finally an Arabic numeral representing the individual gene in the subfamily.	1

Human OATP isoforms are identified by the root protein symbol "OATP" or gene symbol "SLCO" followed by a family number, subfamily letter and individual protein/gene number.	1
The G protein (Golf and/or Gs) in turn stimulates adenylate cyclase to make cAMP.	Odorant molecules, once bound to ORs, activate a G protein-coupled transduction cascade by activating the olfactory G protein Golf, which in turn activates adenylate cyclase III, leading to the production of cAMP and culminating in the opening of two types of ion channels, CNG and Ca2+-activated Cl- channels.	4
The G protein (Golf and/or Gs) in turn stimulates adenylate cyclase to make cAMP.	As a stimulatory G protein (Gs)-coupled receptor, EP2 activation by PGE2 stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC), resulting in elevation of cytoplasmic cAMP level to initiate multiple downstream events via its prototypical effector-PKA.	2
Olfactory receptors (ORs) play a central role in olfaction, the sense of smell.	Among vertebrates, the sense of smell is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs) expressed in sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium.	4.5
Binding of an odorant to the olfactory receptor induces a conformational change that leads to the activation of the olfactory-specific G protein (Golf).	When the odorant binds to its receptor, cellular downstream signaling is initiated through the activation of the olfactory-type G protein (Golf), which activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) to increase intracellular cAMP levels.	4.5
